This game is a 3D first person horror game called Insomnia that involves puzzle solving. It revolves around the character being trapped in the bedroom and being unable to fall asleep. They have until 
3 AM to finish their tasks posted on the to-do list before their mother comes to check up on them if they are asleep. 

Insomnia is coded in Processing, an IDE that allows the translation of code to visual arts.
